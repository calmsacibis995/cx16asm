# cx16asm
A macro assembler for the Commander X16. Derived from the C64 macro assembler sources [here](https://github.com/mist64/cbmsrc/tree/master/ASSEMBLER_C64_REC).

## Unimplemented features
 * 65c02 support
 * 65816 support
 * ROM R49 support

## Bugs (in progress)
 * If no input is given to any of the prompts, the program crashes and puts the user into the monitor.
 * Attempting to compile a program (tested with Omega Race) causes BASIC to throw an `?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR`.
 * You tell me the rest! Make an issue with your bug described and I will try to respond as quickly as I can.
